Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.\n",

It was quite slow moving, with a lot of emphasis on Doyle's frustration at Sherlock Holmes which was very accurate and excellently portrayed. It was an interesting character study and very well shot ( on digital video, unusual for a period piece ). The acting was excellent all round, particularly Tim McInnery and Brian Cox although the actor who portrayed ACD, whose name I cannot remember impressed me no end. An excellent character study which has about the same amount of twists as any normal Sherlock Holmes case. Do see this if you get the chance\",\n",

              " '\"Kalifornia\" is one of my all-time favourite movies, and it easily could be labeled as one of the best psychological thrillers of the 90`s. The film has a very stylish surface to it, but behind that are a lot of disturbing and honest depictions of homicidal maniacs and the terrifyng violence they inflict upon others. One of the film`s strongest aspects is it`s performances, Brad Pitt is startlingly great as a trailer-trash psycho named Early. Pitt potrays his frightening character almost flawlessly. Juliette Lewis is equally as good playing his naive girlfriend, her innocence is almost heart-breaking. \"Kalifornia\" has a very simple plot to it, that goes steadily and slowly forward for about an hour, but it suddenly plunges into a harrowing spree of murder, as Pitt unleashes his psychotic personality. There are alot of shocking scenes, and it all mounts to a power-house climax that will haunt you for days. \"Kalifonia\" is a film that should really be watched for it`s intense look at how monstrous a human being can be, and not only for it`s violence and gore.',\n",
              " 'This film concerns the story of Eddy as mentioned in the title and his homecoming to old friends in a seaside community. The plot involves the group of friends as it comes to light that Eddy left as a means to deal with death of a friend in which he feels in some way responsible. But this is inconsequential, as the choices made in the production are extremely poor and not fully realized. Screenplays not always need be \\'chatty\\', but they should at least assist the development of the story. Here one line attempts such as \"he just took off\" or \"I know you don\\'t have love in heart\" just do fully evoke something worth the audience\\'s time. Also whenever the writer feels at a loss to where to go to next he cuts to a music montage of the protagonist walking through fields to some indie mood music. Talk about trying to hard. If you are interested in a good film, the type that gives quality and substance over just style then this is not the film for you.',\n",
              " \"I like Chris Rock, but I feel he is wasted in this film. The idea of remaking Heaven Can Wait is fine, but the filmmakers followed the plot of that turkey too closely. When Eddie Murphy remade Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor, he re-did them totally -- so they became Murphy films/vehicles, not just tepid remakes. That's why they were successful. If Chris had done the same, this could have been a much better film. The few laughs that come are when he is doing his standup routine -- so he might as well have done a concert film. It also would have been much funnier if the white man whose body he inhabits was a truck driver or hillbilly. So why does Hollywood keep making junk like this? Because people go to see it -- because they like Chris Rock. So give Chris a decent script and give us better movies! Don't remake films that weren't that good in the first place!\",\n",

In the advertising of this movie, that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, but she's a poor actress, and not as good looking as people try to make her out to be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And what's with that look she gives everyone? Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably good, judging by the plot line, but next time I'll read the book to find out rather than watch this.\",\n",

It\\'s not like \"Lock, Stock...\" or \"Snatch\", in the sense that it isn\\'t that funny (in fact, it\\'s pretty dark), and it is a lot more intelligent, in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself). The way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned, is that it is full of memorable characters, specifically Statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the lead, and Ray Liotta, who spends most of the film in Speedos, but gives a great performance none the less. If you\\'ve got time, and have time afterwards to think about the film, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film. I think it\\'s fantastic, and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game.',\n",
              " 'Tierney\\'s an authentic tough guy, but this movie misfire from normally competent RKO undercuts his impact at every turn. The script is about as plausible as OJ Simpson at a Ten Cmmandments dinner. Just count the times Tierney\\'s incredible car companions swallow one lame excuse after another for his evasive and violent acts. The old cliché about it \"only happening in the movies\" applies here in spades. Then there\\'s the guy playing the watchman, who appears to have wandered in from a boozy WC Fields comedy, ruining the menacing mood in the process. The static one-room sets don\\'t help either, and neither does director Feist\\'s obvious lack of feel for the material. Then add a final car chase missing both imagination and pay-off, and the results are pretty flat. In fact the movie only picks up in the station-house scenes where hard-bitten cops discover the hidden powers of innocent-looking gas station attendants. Too bad that Tieney\\'s career never really gelled. I gather that was due largely to being as big a tough guy off-screen as on and getting in one sleazy scrape after another. His ice-cold manner and clarity of emotion remind me at times of Lee Marvin at his tough-guy best. Anyway this project might have worked as a radio play, but as a movie with a promising noir title, it\\'s a disappointment.',\n",
              " \"This was a superb episode, one of the best of both seasons. Down right horror for a change, with a story that is way way above the average MOH episodes, if there is such a thing. A man's wife is almost burned to death in a tragic car wreck, in which he was driving. His airbag worked, her's didn't. She is burned beyond recognition (great makeup btw), and not given much of a chance to live without a full skin graft. BUT, even in a coma, she keeps dying but brought back by modern technology, and when she does die for a few minutes, her ghost appears as a very vengeful spirit. Carnage of course ensues, and also some extremely gory killings, and also, some extremely sexy scenes. What more could you ask for, you might ask? Well, not much, because this baby has it all, and a very satirical ending, that should leave a smile on most viewers faces. I just loved Rob Schmidt's (Wrong Turn) direction too, he has a great knack for horror. Excellent episode, this is one I'm buying for sure.\"]"

footage if the air force had film of jets firing rockets it was used unfortunately it is ruined by too much melodrama and an impossible time line br br the movie concerns a missile from space that is attacked by the soviets and inadvertently diverted into a low atmospheric orbit at under five miles and at a speed in excess of miles it emits an exhaust of a million degrees burning up everything on the ground including glaciers distant early warning dew line bases and eskimos br br every attempt at destroying the missile fails br br the first flaws in this film appear early on while we don t expect much from low budget films some things can t be forgotten like a little research for instance both the soviets and the us fire anti ballistic missiles that home in on the missile with unerring accuracy however the first successful abm tests weren t done until march of by the russians br br there is too much melodrama dr loring loggia and his assistant joan woods ellen parker play their romance with about as much wood as a log cabin parker s character cries and boo hoos at loggia s sacrifice like she was at a screen test loggia is about as heroic as a bored businessman a scientist phillip pine hams it up so much he makes william shatner look like a thespian a bus driver continually spits out end of the world crap in scene after scene the only good actor is the film narrator played by veteran character actor lawrence dobkins naked city br br all of this could be overlooked if it wasn t for the time line after the missile s info is sent to dc the pentagon brings in a group of scientists a general larry kerr announces that the missile will hit new york city in minutes after this there are discussions by scientists and there is a deadly lull as word is sought from ambassadors to see if the missile is an attack from the russians and if a response is necessary br br the film shows the military being fully scrambled civil defense people leave work and go to their stations eight million people scramble to fallout shelters while school buses pick up millions of kids and we get to see the whitest new york city i ve ever seen though watching s sci fi films made it seems like this was the standard the press is kept in the dark for tens of minutes then incredibly a man at the pentagon announces that the missile will hit ottawa canada in minutes all of the aforementioned action happened in minutes then to add fuel to the fire loggia somehow thinks of a way to stop the alien missile he slowly produces a caseload of plutonium loads it in a jeep and takes it from dc to a distant missile base to put it atop a missile along the way he is knocked off the road by a wild driver breaks down and then is carjacked he finally gets the plutonium back and drives to the base to arm the missile again all this in the same minute time frame br br the movie also irks the viewer by making it seem as if ottawa might be saved only to show men women and children get roasted the missile is then said to have five minutes to reach new york loggia is still driving to the base more miles to go he gets to the base and arms the missile a two minute countdown is then announced all within five minutes the boroughs of new york should have been at least scorched br br by the way the missile is destroyed if you haven t guessed the abm warhead destroys it with a massive plutonium based nuclear blast five seconds later the blast dissipates and all is clear yeah they caused a nuclear blast equivalent to hiroshimas on the outskirts of new york city and nothing happens br br the film had all the elements necessary to be a good b film but wasted them loggia played his character so lamely you didn t care that he sacrificed himself in the end you didn t care about the other characters not even the smarmy scientist played by pine the tension that should have moved the film along just wasn t physically possible in the time line allowed it still wouldn t be today not even with jack bauer br br this film is very difficult to find as far as i know it hasn t been re issued on any medium and for good reason i don t know if the film meant to be or if it was standard practice but there s a scene where the government sends all of the best scientists military men and businessmen into deep shelters saying they re too valuable to lose there isn t a single woman or minority in the bunch hari rhodes is the only black man in the film and he gets a brief bit playing a piano it was worse than days where an alien gives five earthlings the chance to either save or destroy the planet and he doesn t include any blacks or hispanics br br i saw this on a special sci fi night on turner classic movies and i don t expect it to show up again if you do find a

was not a major star for the filming of midnight cowboy his actual salary would surprise you i think he was robbed no one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it made him a star for such great work as deliverance he defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie the end of the s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hip br br i also did not find any homosexuality between ratzo and joe they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another they found a much purely higher relationship true friendship if you didn t understand that at the end of the movie then you ve wasted your time joe s bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent yes voight

the family who grew up with lila and buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small new england town ann immediately becomes enamored of harris which adds a complication to the fact that lila has always been in love with harris and continues to be buddy also is in love with harris but being he has redirected that homosexual desire for harris to his good friend ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic wise cracking bad boy of the family much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parents br br needless to say all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy after all this is a chick flick br br in the present time ann s daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife nina having always felt inferior cannot maintain a relationship br br stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years and you get an intriguing look at society its values and its effects upon the personalities and

this film so very very special br br claire danes plays the s ann and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as

fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watch br br toni collette plays ann s other daughter nina nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister collette is perfect for a part such as this but i have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she plays br br mamie gummer plays s lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend ann she is very good br br meryl streep gummer s mother plays present day lila what is there to say about meryl streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performance br br director lajos koltai states in the dvd extras that he sought out glenn close to play the relatively small part of lila s mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film he certainly was right and close s performance in that one scene etches it in your mind all the other scenes in which close is lila s very proper mother and you get another performance to treasure br br there are three other scenes in the film combined with the one featuring close described above that make the whole movie worth watching on lila s wedding day ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss lila s misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love this scene is repeated fifty years later when lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend ann to talk about the lives they have lived in this latter scene streep and redgrave are enthralling br br the other memorable scene at least to me is when buddy declares his love for ann hugh dancy as buddy gives us a

other than with the leading man very sad br br also i just thought that id point something mentioned on the message boards which i felt was actually true the straight men are all hotter than the gay

only thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this show br br sure there is the twist but if you have any semblance of gaydar in you you ll easily discern who s who it wasn t hard at all i was only wrong once this show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere else br br we get to watch as james co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to western step dance shopping for gifts visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke yawn sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway that s one of main problems with the show no one seems to be enjoying themselves they are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time and you really cant blame them since the
